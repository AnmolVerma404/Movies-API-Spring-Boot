# Project Name
## Description


## Spring Boot
Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework that is part of the larger Spring ecosystem. It simplifies the process of building production-ready, stand-alone, and web-based applications. Spring Boot takes an opinionated approach, providing default configurations and sensible defaults to get your application up and running quickly with minimal configuration.

### Key Features and Benefits
- Opinionated Defaults: Spring Boot provides sensible defaults and configuration options out-of-the-box, which means developers spend less time on setup and more time on application logic.

- Auto-Configuration: Spring Boot automatically configures components based on the dependencies you include in your project. This feature significantly reduces boilerplate code and configuration.

- Embedded Server: Spring Boot includes an embedded server (usually Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) that allows you to run your application as a standalone JAR file, making deployment and testing much simpler.

- Spring Actuator: Spring Boot Actuator provides out-of-the-box production-ready features like health checks, metrics, and monitoring, which makes it easier to manage and monitor your application in production.

- Starter Dependencies: Spring Boot Starter POMs are pre-configured dependencies that enable easy integration with various technologies and frameworks, such as Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, etc.

- Microservices-Friendly: Spring Boot is well-suited for building microservices architectures due to its lightweight nature and ease of deployment.

## Architecture
Spring Boot follows a layered architectural pattern, similar to the traditional Spring framework. The key architectural components in a Spring Boot application are:

- Presentation Layer: This layer handles user interactions and displays information to the users. In your case, the React frontend will serve as the presentation layer, interacting with the backend API provided by the Spring Boot application.

- Controller Layer: In Spring Boot, the controller layer consists of classes annotated with @RestController, which handle incoming HTTP requests and return appropriate responses. These controllers act as the bridge between the frontend and the backend services.

- Service Layer: The service layer contains business logic and is responsible for processing data and coordinating between the controller and the data access layer. Services are usually annotated with @Service.

- Data Access Layer: The data access layer, also known as the persistence layer, interacts with databases or external APIs to store and retrieve data. It includes repositories (using Spring Data JPA) or DAO (Data Access Objects) classes.

- Configuration: Spring Boot relies heavily on configuration, which can be provided through various means like application properties, YAML files, or Java configuration classes. Configuration files play a crucial role in setting up various components and services within the application.

- Dependency Injection: Spring Boot's core principle is dependency injection, which enables loose coupling between different components of the application. It allows for easier unit testing and better maintainability.
